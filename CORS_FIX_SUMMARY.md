# CORS Fix Summary

## Problem
The frontend at `https://www.peerverse.in` was getting CORS errors when trying to access the Railway backend API at `https://gleaming-inspiration-production-5a37.up.railway.app/api/session-feedback`.

## Root Cause
The CORS configuration in the backend was not properly handling requests from the frontend domain.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Global CORS Middleware
- Added dynamic origin checking for multiple allowed domains
- Added debug logging to identify CORS issues
- Improved error handling for requests without origin

### 2. Specific Session-Feedback Endpoint Fix
- Added explicit CORS headers to `/api/session-feedback` endpoint
- Added dedicated OPTIONS handler for preflight requests
- Ensured proper credentials and method handling

### 3. Updated Allowed Origins
```javascript
const allowedOrigins = [
  'https://www.peerverse.in',
  'https://peerverse.in',
  'https://peerverse-final.vercel.app',
  'http://localhost:3000',
  'http://localhost:3001'
];
```

## Deployment Steps

1. **Deploy Backend to Railway:**
   ```bash
   cd BACKEND
   railway up
   ```

2. **Test CORS Fix:**
   - Open `test-cors.html` in browser
   - Click "Test CORS" button
   - Should see successful response

3. **Verify Session Feedback:**
   - Test the feedback modal in your app
   - Check browser console for any remaining CORS errors

## Files Modified
- `BACKEND/server.js` - Enhanced CORS configuration
- `test-cors.html` - CORS testing tool (new)
- `deploy-backend.bat` - Deployment script (new)

## Expected Result
After deployment, the session feedback functionality should work without CORS errors, and the API should properly accept requests from `https://www.peerverse.in`.
